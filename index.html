    <div class="docs-section" id="introduction">
      <h4>Rationale</h4>

      <p>In 2019, over 100 students, Postdocs, and senior scientists from all over the world came together at Kashiwa campus near Tokyo to discuss the status and future of the searches for dark matter. Now, while a year  has passed with exciting new results, the nature of dark matter still remains elusive. To ultimately solve the mystery of dark matter, it is clear that a joint effort is needed by future indirect, direct and collider experiments. To foster the exchange between the fields and to exchange recent progresses in theory and experiment, we have promised to establish a regular series of yearly meetings: the <i>Kashiwa dark matter symposia</i>. This year in 2020, due to the world-wide Covid19 pandemic, the symposium place will be virtual.</p>
      <p>The goal of this year’s symposium is to bring together international researchers from all relevant experimental and theoretical fields, and of current and future dark matter searches. This year, we aim at a special focus on alternative dark matter candidates beyond the WIMP paradigm, including a dedicated session on axions and axion-like particles.</p>

      <p>We encourage especially young researchers and students to attend and to present at the symposium.</p>

    <div class="docs-section" id="schedule">
      <h5 class="docs-header">Schedule and format</h5>

      <p> To allow maximum participation from all time zones and concentration during an online meeting, the symposium will last for <b>four hours</b> on each day from <b>Monday, Nov. 16 to Thursday, Nov. 19</b>.  On each day, we will have two sessions of 90 minutes duration, separated by a coffee break. Sessions include an invited highlight talk, followed by contributed talks of 12' plus 3' question time. We will allocate the daily symposium times to the maximum convenience of presenters and registrants <b>end of October</b>. We will also establish a space to present digital posters at the conference by Slack exchange during the time of the symposium.</p>

    <div class="docs-section" id="conduct">
      <h5 class="docs-header">Code of Conduct</h5>

      <p>Attendance at SAZERAC is not a right but a privilege, and attendees are expected to behave professionally. The SAZERAC organizers are committed to providing an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas.</p>

      <p>This document establishes a code of conduct for all attendees of SAZERAC.  By participating in SAZERAC in any way, including as an attendee, a presenter, or an organizer, you agree to abide by this code of conduct.  Failure to adhere to this code of conduct in all SAZERAC-related circumstances, including in the main session webinars, in the Slack channels, other SAZERAC-related events, or any in person, telephone, or other electronic communication related to SAZERAC, will result in removal from all conference events.</p>

      <p>Our scientific community values all members, regardless of (alphabetically) age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender expression, gender identity, marital status, nationality, physical appearance, political affiliation, pregnancy, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and status as a caregiver (including as a parent).  The ability of SAZERAC to allow our community to share its research results and promote the careers of junior attendees depends critically on maintaining a culture of inclusivity, where all voices are respected and heard.</p>

      <p>SAZERAC will not tolerate verbal, nonverbal, physical, or sexual harassment or bullying of any kind. Behavior and language acceptable to one person may not be to another. Unwelcome attention, threatening or abusive language, insulting, hurtful, or disrespectful comments, are strictly banned from SAZERAC. Members must make every effort to ensure that words and actions communicate respect for others, regardless of opinion regarding the person or their scientific results.</p>

      <p>SAZERAC places a high priority on eliminating sexual harassment in any form from the workplace.  As a rule, sexual advancements should not take place in any professional setting, including social events related to a professional event. Members should be especially conscientious of real or perceived power gradients such as seniority, status, or reputation, that may place a member in a vulnerable position.</p>

      <p>SAZERAC is not a public event.  All attendees must register via the website, and should not share the connection information to Zoom or Slack with non-registered people.  When connecting to Zoom or slack, all attendees should use their own name, and not attempt to misrepresent themselves.</p>

      <p>During SAZERAC sessions, the Session Chair is in charge.  Speakers must keep to their allotted time, ideally using a timer.  If they exceed their time, their question time will be reduced, and if they speak through all of the question time, they will be disconnected.  When asking questions of speakers, please be professional, courteous, and polite.  If a participant engages in obvious harassing behavior during the presentations, the Chairs may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or removing them from the conference.</p>

      <p>SAZERAC participants who believe that they have witnessed or been negatively impacted by a possible violation of the Code of Conduct should contact the SOC by emailing <a href="malto:soc@sazerac-conference.org">soc@sazerac-conference.org</a> to initiate a complaint, including any available evidence (e.g., screenshots) in their email.  If a majority of the SOC concurs that this code has been violated, the offender will be immediately removed from all SAZERAC events.  The offender will then be contacted by the SOC, and will have the opportunity to appeal the decision.  This appeal will be considered by the SOC, whose decision will be final.</p>
