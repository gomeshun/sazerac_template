oleg.brandt@cern.ch,Oleg,Brandt,University of Cambridge,Yes,,1A,1,Mon 16,1005,"Hunting for Dark Matter using proton-proton collisions at the LHC","The talk will give an exposition of searches for Dark Matter using proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC, recorded with the ATLAS and CMS detectors. A particular focus will be placed on coverage of various experimental signatures and their phenomenological interplay within the context of simplified models. A connection to Dark Matter searches using direct direction techniques will be outlined.","Collider searches, Invited talk, Session A"
taisuke.katayose@ipmu.jp,Taisuke,Katayose,Kavli IPMU,Yes,,1A,2,Mon 16,1035,"Non-relativistic effect on indirect probe of EWIMPs at colliders","The Electroweakly interacting massive particle (EWIMP) is a good candidate for dark matter, and many efforts are taken to search this kind of dark matter experimentally. We discuss the collider search for EWIMPs and especially indirect probes which cause the radiative correction to the standard model Drell-Yan process. We point out that there is non-negligible higher order correction at the non-relativistic region, and have calculated that correction using non-perturbative way.","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session A"
laura.molina.bueno@cern.ch,Laura, Molina Bueno,ETH Zürich,Yes,,1A,3,Mon 16,1050,"Latest results of NA64 experiment","The existence of dark sectors is an exciting possibility to explain the origin of Dark Matter (DM). In addition to gravity, DM could interact with ordinary matter through a new very weak force. This new interaction could be mediated by a new massive vector boson, called dark photon (A’). If A’ exists, it could be produced through the kinetic mixing with a bremsstrahlung photon from a high-energy electron scattering in a target. A' could then decay invisibly into light DM particles, A′→χχ, or visibly, into e+e-. Searching for the former in events with large missing energy allows us to probe the γ−A′ mixing strength and the parameter space close to the one predicted by the relic dark matter density. Motivation for searching visible decays, has been recently enhanced by the anomaly observed in the 8Be and 4He nuclei transitions that could be explained by the existence of a 17 MeV boson also decaying into e+e-. In this talk, we present the latest NA64 results from the combined 2016-2018 data analysis for visible and invisible modes, and the future prospects in 2021. New recent results on axionlike and scalar particles searches produced though Primakoff reaction will also be discussed.","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session A"
hiroaki.hibi@cern.ch,Hiroaki,Hibi,Kobe University,Yes,,1A,4,Mon 16,1105,"New low-pT lepton ID method for Higgsino search at FCC-hh","The lightest neutral SUSY particle (LSP) is known as a candidate for dark matter. Recent measurements of the relic density of dark matter suggest a scenario in which the mass difference between the LSP and the second lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) is compressed. In collider experiments, a promising channel to search for such a compressed region is the channel that the NLSP decays into LSP and leptons. The FCC-hh is a next-generation proton-proton collider with a 100 TeV center of mass energy. It will enable us to search for LSP in higher mass regions. On the other hand, the kinematics of the leptons in the final state strongly depends on the mass difference between NLSP and LSP. In the compressed region, low momentum leptons are dominant and it is difficult to identify leptons by conventional methods. Therefore, even if the NLSP can be generated, the signal cannot be found. To solve this problem, we have developed a dedicated lepton identification algorithm for low-momentum leptons with a deep neural network(DNN) technique. In this talk, we report on the DNN method and its expected performance with the proposed FCC-hh detector.","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session A"
julio@lipi.go.id,J,Julio,Indonesian Institute of Science,Yes,,1A,5,Mon 16,1120,"Collider constraints on a dark matter interpretation of the XENON1T excess","Recently, XENON1T Collaboration has reported an excess on low-energy recoil events. Several new physics scenarios have been put forward to explain such excess. In this talk, I will discuss one of scenarios, i.e., a fast-moving dark matter with low velocity (i.e., 0.05--0.2) and mass between 1 MeV and 10 GeV scattering off an electron. Assuming the fast moving DM-electron interaction is mediated by a vector particle, we derive collider constraints on the DM-electron interaction. The bounds on DM-electron coupling is then used to constrain possible production mechanisms of the fast moving DM. We find that the preferred mass of the vector mediator is relatively light (≲ 1 GeV) and the coupling of the vector to the electron is much smaller than the coupling to the fast moving DM.","Collider searches, Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session A"
Anastasia.Sokolenko@oeaw.ac.at,Anastasia,Sokolenko,HEPHY/Austrian Academy of Sciences,Yes,,1B,1,Mon 16,1200,"Searches for dark particles in the Intergalactic Medium","In this talk we consider the model with light dark matter (e.g. axions) decaying into dark photons. In particular, such a model was used to explain the strength of 21 cm absorption observed by EDGES. To constrain this model, we consider the propagation of dark photons through the Intergalactic Medium and, utilizing the results from the EAGLE simulation, show that dark photons can be resonantly converted into ordinary photons at numerous places along a typical line-of-sights. This results in distortions both in the energy spectrum and small-scale anisotropies in the CMB. Comparing these predictions with the brightness temperature measurements of COBE/FIRAS and the CMB anisotropy measurements of Planck and SPT allows us to rule out a significant portion of the parameter space of the model.","DM Astrophysics, Theory, Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session B"

I will present the most recent results on the distribution of their gravitating and baryonic mass obtained from our projects XMM-Newton Cluster Outskirts Project (X-COP) and CLASH, and how we will improve these constraints with our on-going XMM-Newton Heritage Cluster Project, highlighting the role of X-ray (and SZ data) in resolving the astrophysics of the most massive collapsed halos in the universe and in studying the interplay between the hot plasma and the dark matter.","DM Astrophysics, Contributed talk, Session B"
mariabenitocst@gmail.com	,María,Benito,National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics (NICPB),Yes,,1B,3,Mon 16,1230,"Dark Matter in the Milky Way: distribution and uncertainties","The observational determination of the Dark Matter distribution in the Milky Way is affected by different sources of astrophysical uncertainties. I will describe each of these sources of uncertainty and quantify, by means of a data-driven analysis, their effect on the estimated Dark Matter density. I will show that the uncertainties on the Dark Matter distribution and their impact on searches of physics beyond the standard model stays sizable even with state-of-the-art determinations of astrophysical quantities of relevance (such as the Sun’s circular velocity and its distance to the Galactic center).","DM Astrophysics, Contributed talk, Session B"
a.gallo@unito.it,Arianna,Gallo,University of Turin,Yes,,1B,4,Mon 16,1245,"Constraining the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo through hypervelocity stars","Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) models predict the existence of DM halos surrounding individual galaxies, including the Milky Way (MW). The shape of these halos is one of the testable predictions of ΛCDM: for MW-like galaxies, numerical simulations predict triaxial DM halos. To constrain the shape of the MW DM halo, we resort to hypervelocity stars (HVSs): HVSs are ejected from the center of the MW at very high speeds and cross the whole DM halo to the outer region, where they are currently observed. HVSs can thus be a powerful probe of the distribution of the DM of the MW. We developed a new statistical method that, when applied to mock catalogs of a few hundred HVSs, can recover the correct shape of the DM halo in 95% of the cases. The number of HVSs currently observed is limited to a few tens, but this number is expected to increase in the near future. Our method will thus significantly constrain the shape of the DM halo of our Galaxy.","DM Astrophysics, Contributed talk, Session B"
mlisanti@princeton.edu,Mariangela,Lisanti,Princeton University,Yes,,1B,5,Mon 16,1300,"Mapping the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo with Gaia","The Gaia mission is in the process of mapping nearly 1% of the Milky Way’s stars----nearly a billion in total.  This data set is unprecedented and provides a unique view into the formation history of our Galaxy and its associated dark matter halo.  I will review results based on the most recent Gaia data release, demonstrating how the evolution of the Galaxy can be deciphered from the stellar remnants of massive satellite galaxies that merged with the Milky Way early on.  This analysis is an inherently "big data" problem, and I will discuss how we are leveraging machine learning techniques to advance our understanding of the Galaxy's evolution.  Our results indicate that the local dark matter is not in equilibrium, as typically assumed, and instead exhibits distinctive dynamics tied to the disruption of satellite galaxies.  The updated dark matter map built from the Gaia data has ramifications for direct detection experiments, which search for the interactions of these particles in terrestrial targets.","DM Astrophysics, Invited talk, Session B"
