james.frost@physics.ox.ac.uk,James,Frost,University of Oxford,,,,,1A,1,Tue 29.11.,0635,Dark matter searches at the LHC (excluding SUSY),"The presence of a non-baryonic Dark Matter (DM) component in the Universe has been inferred from the observation of its gravitational interaction. If Dark Matter interacts weakly with the Standard Model (SM) it could be produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, escaping the detector and leaving a large missing transverse momentum as its signature.
The LHC experiments have developed a broad search program for DM candidates, in signatures with large missing transverse momentum produced in association with other particles (including light and heavy quarks, Z and H bosons, as well as additional heavy scalar particles), direct resonance searches for mediator particles coupling dark matter to the SM, and searches for invisible Higgs decays as would result if the Higgs boson provides a direct portal to dark matter. Searches have also been made for extended or strongly-interacting dark sectors, that can result in long-lived or novel hadronic signatures. A review of recent collider DM searches on 13 TeV proton-proton data, their interplay and interpretations will be presented.","Collider Searches, Invited talk, in person"
chen@icepp.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,Shion,Chen,The University of Tokyo/ICEPP,,,,,1A,2,Tue 29.11.,0715,Dark matter searches at LHC (SUSY dark matters),"SUSY dark matter - specifically electroweakinos - have been the leading candidate of the WIMP dark matter as well as the significant cause of the ""WIMP miracle"" excitement. While the search for the direct production is challenging due to the small production cross-section compared with the strongly-produced SUSYs, the large data sample size and the new search techniques in LHC Run2 starts to overcome the bottleneck, enabling one to probe drastically heavier electroweakinos these years. This talk will outline the search program at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, review what we have achieved/we couldn't achieve during the Run2, and discuss the strategy for the LHC Run3 and HL-LHC onward.","Collider Searches, Invited talk, in person"
motoko.fujiwara@tum.de,Motoko,Fujiwara,Technical University of Munich,,,,,1B,1,Tue 29.11.,0830,Current status of WIMP Dark Matter: Theory and Search,"I will present the theoretical aspects of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and the current status of its experimental searches. This WIMP scenario has a high possibility for the identification of dark matter since we may probe its predictions through the various interaction processes. For the identification process, we have two essential directions: revealing distinctive signatures and realizing a comprehensive search strategy to test each scenario. I will briefly review recent progress focusing on some benchmark scenarios. ","DM Theory, Invited talk, online"
yin.wen.b3@tohoku.ac.jp,Wen,Yin,Tohoku University,,,,,1B,2,Tue 29.11.,0910,Axion dark matter ,"In this talk, I briefly review a light dark matter candidate, which is called axion. The axion may or may not solve the strong CP problem of the standard model, depending on the interaction with the standard model particles. I try to provide a few answers to the questions ""what is axion?”, ""how to produce axion in the early Universe?"" and “how to search for it?”. ","DM Theory, Invited talk, in person"
lnecib@mit.edu,Lina,Necib,MIT,,,,,2A,1,Wed 30.11.,0030,Shining light on Dark Matter,"In this talk, I explore the impact of stellar kinematics on understanding the particle nature of Dark Matter, overviewing the correlations between stellar and Dark Matter phase space distributions in four separate locations: the solar neighborhood, the Galactic center, dwarf galaxies, and streams. I will then focus on the use of machine learning techniques to disentangle the local kinematics substructures, and the use of simulations to study the correlations between stars and Dark Matter. I will present the results of a stable clustering algorithm to find the local structures, and outline the relationship between these stellar substructures and Dark Matter direct detection.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Invited talk, online"
miyatake@kmi.nagoya-u.ac.jp,Hironao,Miyatake,"KMI, Nagoya University",,,,,2A,2,Wed 30.11.,0110,First Measurement of Dark Matter Distribution around 1.5 Million Galaxies at z∼4,"Dark matter is invisible, but it makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe. Therefore, it is important to measure the dark matter distribution to investigate the cosmological evolution of cosmic structure. Gravitational lensing, which is observed as the bending of the light from background sources due to the foreground massive structure, is a unique, powerful tool to measure the dark matter distribution directly. Lensing measurements of dark matter distribution around galaxies have been limited up to z~1 because there were not a sufficient number of lens and source galaxies beyond that redshift. In this talk, I report the first measurement of dark matter distribution around galaxies at z~4, which is enabled by the large (1.5 million) distant galaxy sample at z~4 built from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey data and by the use of cosmic microwave background measured by the Planck satellite as a source. I will also discuss the cosmological constraint obtained by combining the lensing measurement and clustering of the z~4 galaxies.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Invited talk, online"
chengyu@sjtu.edu.cn,Yu,Cheng,TDLI&SJTU,,,,,2B,1,Wed 30.11.,0230,Forbidden Dark Matter Combusted Around Black Hole,"Forbidden DM is a class of models whose relic density is generated dominantly by annihilating into heavier partner particles in the early Universe. The annihilations and hence the possibility of indirect detection turn off at late times. 
We point out the possibility of testing forbidden dark matter models around the super-massive black holes. The scenario generates unique signals such as gamma-ray emitting around the black hole which can serve as smoking gun of the forbidden dark matter.","DM Theory, Contributed talk, in person"
inui.ryoto.a3@s.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp,Ryoto,Inui,Nagoya University,,,,,2B,2,Wed 30.11.,0245,Induced stochastic gravitational waves associated with primordial black holes as dark matter in the exponential-tailed case,"Recently, primordial black holes (PBHs) have been attracting much attention as candidates for dark matter (DM). The large density fluctuations necessary for PBH production induce gravitational waves as a side effect, therefore gravitational wave observations could verify whether PBHs occupy the whole DM indirectly. It is required to correctly associate the PBH abundance with the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum and the statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations for accurate verification. In this study, we focus on the statistical fluctuation called the exponential tail, which has a heavier probability distribution function than the Gaussian distribution. We investigate the scalar-induced gravitational wave spectrum when PBH exists as a whole DM.","DM Theory, Contributed talk, online"
utkarshp@iitbhilai.ac.in,Utkarsh,Patel,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bhilai",,,,,2B,3,Wed 30.11.,0300,SIDM as a solution to small scale crisis,"We consider the scenario of self-interacting dark matter(SIDM) with a light mediator in a model independent way, which can alleviate two long standing issues of the small scale cosmology namely cusp vs. core and too-big-to-fail. A Yukawa potential is chosen to achieve mediator exchange between DM particles as part of their self-interactions. The dynamics of self-interacting transfer cross-section is studied for a range of mediator mass($m_Z'$). Also, a relationship is established between the cross-section and DM particles' relative velocity, which ensures the solution to DM crisis at small scales. Our obtained numerical results are efficient compared to the earlier works in the context that lesser number of $\ell$ modes have been used by us to achieve the same level of accuracy in the cross-section calculations. For a better understanding of the SIDM parameter space, we perform an analytical analysis on the dependence of transfer cross-section over the other important SIDM parameters using a Hulth\'{e}n potential which is similar in it's behaviour to Yukawa potential. A detailed evolution of particle dynamics using the Boltzmann equation and the effect of sommerfeld enhancement on such calculations has also been studied here. We also provide a minimal anomaly-free leptophilic extension of standard model, that can incorporate SIDM and its mediator candidate in the framework.","DM Theory, Contributed talk, online"
violetta.sagun@uc.pt,Violetta,Sagun,University of Coimbra,,,,,2B,4,Wed 30.11.,0315,Compact stars as dark matter probes,"Compact stars due to their enormous gravitational field can accumulate a sizable amount of dark matter in their interior. Depending on its nature, accumulated dark matter may affect the properties of neutron stars in quite different ways. I will give an overview of the impact of dark matter on various observable properties of compact stars, considering also a possibility of a phase transition to quark-gluon plasma in the core of a hybrid star. I will show how dark matter condensed in a core modifies the properties of hybrid stars and the onset of the phase transition.

As a result, an accumulated dark matter inside compact stars could mimic an apparent softening/stiffening of strongly interacting matter equation of state and constraints we impose on it at high densities. From the performed analysis of the effect of dark matter particles in a MeV-GeV mass scale, interaction strength, and relative dark matter fractions inside compact stars we obtained a rigorous constraint on model parameters. Finally, we discuss several smoking guns of the presence of dark matter that are free from the above-mentioned degeneracy between the effect of dark matter and properties of strongly interacting matter. These signals could be probed with the future and ongoing astrophysical and gravitational wave surveys.","DM Theory, Contributed talk, online"
matrideb1@gmail.com,Deep,Ghosh,Indian Association for the cultivation of sceince Kolkata,,,,,2B,5,Wed 30.11.,0330,Revisiting big bang nucleosynthesis with a new particle species : effect of co-annihilation with neutrons,"In big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) the light matter abundances are dependent on the neutron-to-proton ratio which is controlled by standard electro-weak processes. Here we study the effect of new particle species which co-annihilates with neutron thereby potentially can reduce the neutron-to-proton ratio at the relevant epoch. However, the co-annihilation process also controls the chemical phase of the newly added particle, thus modifies the number density of the particle. We find a novel interplay between standard electro-weak process and the co-annihilation in deciding the freeze-out value of the neutron-to-proton ratio as well as the final abundance of the new particle. allowrd from the BBN constraint. We further discuss the possibility of this new particle to be a dark matter candidate.","DM Theory, Contributed talk, online"
B.Fu@soton.ac.uk,Bowen,Fu,University of Southampton,,,,,2B,6,Wed 30.11.,0345,Neutrino mass and the early universe,"The long-existing problem of neutrino mass and mixing can be connected to cosmological phenomena, such as the leptogenesis and the existence of dark matter (DM). In the extension of the type I seesaw model with two right-handed (RH) neutrinos, the seesaw Yukawa can drive the DM production, even with the competition from gravitational effect and constraints from leptogenesis. However, the DM production driven by the seesaw Yukawa is not compatible with the testability of the traditional type I seesaw model, which motivates us to seek a variation. By considering two Higgs doublets, a new type Ib seesaw model is proposed, which can explain the neutrino mass, dark matter and leptogenesis simultaneously while keeping its testability. Moreover, the type Ib seesaw model allows a different approach to dark matter production and stability through a 𝑈(1)′ extension.","DM Theory, Contributed talk, online"
aaronm@lbl.gov,Aaron,Manalaysay,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,,,,,2C,1,Wed 30.11.,0600,Direct Detection of Dark Matter,"Though we know very little about the identity of dark matter, we know that it does not fit into our current understanding of particle physics.  A positive detection of dark matter in a non-gravitational way, and elucidation of its properties, therefore promises to teach us about the nature of the universe on a level more fundamental than that described by the Standard Model.  I describe the approaches to detect dark mater directly in terrestrial experiments, focusing on those that look for it in the form of a new subatomic particle.  As we build larger and larger experiments to look for dark matter particles with mass of order the electroweak-symmetry-breaking scale, the next experiments on the horizon will reach a fundamental limit in sensitivity.  At the same time, exciting new technologies under development will extend the search for dark matter to light particle masses never before explored.","Direct Detection, Invited talk, in person"
tuankhai.bui@ipmu.jp,Tuan Khai,Bui,Kavli IPMU,,,,,2C,2,Wed 30.11.,0640,First Results from XENONnT,"XENONnT is a dark matter (DM) direct detection experiment set up at 1400 m depth at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. It utilizes a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC) filled with 8.5 t liquid xenon, of which 5.9 t is in the active volume, which is instrumented with 494 3-inch photomultiplier tubes. Upgraded from XENON1T, we aim to achieve a better sensitivity for DM searches with a final exposure of 20 ton-years and a lower background level after adding liquid purification, radon distillation, and a neutron veto detector. I will present the current status of the experiment and the result from the low-energy electronic-recoil data from the first science run of XENONnT.","Direct Detection, Invited talk, in person"
hafizh@ibs.re.kr,Hafizh ,Prihtiadi,"Center for Underground Physics, Institute for Basic Science (IBS)",,,,,2C,3,Wed 30.11.,0710,Recent status of dark matter search using NaI(Tl) at the COSINE-100 experiment,"COSINE-100 is a direct detection dark matter experiment that is testing DAMA/LIBRA’s claim of dark matter signature. The COSINE-100 detector is located at the 700-m-deep Yangyang Underground Laboratory (Y2L) in Korea, and data has been continuously taken since September 2016. It consists of ~106 kg of low background NaI(Tl) detectors submerged in a 2 tons liquid scintillator veto counter. In this talk, I present the status of COSINE-100, including the recent results on WIMP and annual modulation search. In addition, I will review ongoing R&D projects for, and the plan for the next phase of the experiment.","Direct Detection, Invited talk, in person"
mkimura@camk.edu.pl,Masato,Kimura,AstroCeNT/NCAC,,,,,2C,4,Wed 30.11.,0740,Status and prospects of the DarkSide program,"The DarkSide program is a direct WIMP dark matter search experiment using a liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr-TPC). Its preceding experiment, DarkSide-50, run from 2015 to 2019 a 50-kg-active-mass LAr-TPC filled with low radioactivity argon from an underground source and produced world-class results for both the low mass (M_WIMP < 10 GeV/c2) and high mass (> 100 GeV/c2) WIMP search. The next stage of the program is the DarkSide-20k detector, a 20-tonne fiducial mass LAr-TPC consisting of gadolinium-loaded acrylic and SiPM-based cryogenic photosensors. It is planned to start data taking from 2026 and it is expected to be free of any instrumental background for exposure of 100 tonne x year. This talk will give the latest updates and prospects on these experiments.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, in person"
purquijo@unimelb.edu.au,Phillip,Urquijo,The University of Melbourne,,,,,2D,1,Wed 30.11.,0900,Design of SUPL and status of the SABRE South assembly and its expected performance.,"The SABRE (Sodium iodide with Active Background REjection) experiment aims to detect an annual rate modulation from dark matter interactions in ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals in order to provide a model independent test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA. It is made up of two separate detectors; SABRE South located at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL), in regional Victoria, Australia, and SABRE North at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS).
SABRE South is designed to disentangle seasonal or site-related effects from the dark matter-like modulated signal by using an active veto and muon detection system. Ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals are immersed in a linear alkyl benzene (LAB) based liquid scintillator veto, further surrounded by passive steel and polyethylene shielding and a plastic scintillator muon veto. Work has been undertaken to understand and mitigate the background processes, that take into account radiation from the detector materials, from both intrinsic and cosmogenic activated processes, and to understand the performance of both the crystal and veto systems.
SUPL is a newly built facility located 1024 m underground (~2900 m water equivalent) within the Stawell Gold Mine and its construction was completed in mid-2022. It is the first deep underground physics laboratory in the Southern Hemisphere. The laboratory will house rare event physics searches, including the upcoming SABRE dark matter experiment, as well as measurement facilities to support low background physics experiments and applications such as radiobiology and quantum computing. The commissioning of SABRE South in SUPL is expected to occur in 2023. This talk will report on the design of SUPL, as well as the general status of the SABRE South assembly and its expected performance.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, in person"
mstahlbe@mpp.mpg.de,Martin,Stahlberg,Max-Planck-Institute for Physics,,,,,2D,2,Wed 30.11.,0945,COSINUS - Cryogenic Search for Dark Matter With Scintillating NaI Calorimeters,"COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches) is a dark matter direct dectection experiment that aims for a model-independent cross-check of the DAMA/LIBRA claim for dark matter. Since 1995, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment is measuring a yearly modulated signal which properties fit well to a local dark matter halo in the Milky Way. The target mass consists of 250 kg of sodium iodide, and the experiment reaches a significance of 13.7 sigma for its claim. COSINUS detectors will read out both the scinitllation light signal and the heat signal caused by particle interactions. Each detector will consist of a NaI absober crystal equipped with a transition edge sensor using the remoTES design and a silicon beaker surrounding the absorber. With the dual-channel readout, which is unique for NaI , different types of interacting particles can be discriminated on an event-by-event basis. This contribution will present the status of the COSINUS experiment and its detectors.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, in person"
mkellerm@mpp.mpg.de,Moritz,Kellermann,Max Planck Institute for Physics,,,,,2D,3,Wed 30.11.,0915,NaI-remoTES: cryogenic calorimeters using sodium iodide in COSINUS,"Low temperature calorimeters operated at milli-Kelvin temperatures are an important tool for the study of dark matter. By using transition edge sensors (TES), small temperature changes on the order of a micro-Kelvin can be measured.

COSINUS is a new dark matter direct detection experiment that uses TES in the ""remoTES"" configuration to measure heat signals of sodium iodide (NaI). In this design, instead of depositing the TES directly on the absorber, the TES is deposited on a separate wafer disk. A gold wire connects the TES with a gold pad on the absorber to transmit phonon signals from scattering events in the crystal.

With the remoTES-configuration the choice of detector materials for low temperature calorimeters is extended to materials that otherwise would not survive the fabrication of a directly deposited TES. The concept was already proven using silicon- and telluriumdioxide absorbers and is currently being optimized for NaI. This contribution presents the remoTES design and the newest results of the NaI -prototypes of the COSINUS experiment.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, in person"
samuele.torelli@gssi.it,Samuele,Torelli,Gran Sasso Science Institute,,,,,2D,4,Wed 30.11.,0930,The CYGNO/INITIUM experiment for directional Dark Matter searches,"The CYGNO/INITIUM project aims to develop a high-precision 3D tracking Time Projection Chamber with optical readout, using a He:CF$_4$ based gas mixture at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The charge amplification system of CYGNO consists of 3 Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs). During the amplification process, CF$_4$ deexcitation produces light, which is collected by PMTs and a scientific CMOS camera. By combining the information of the high-granularity camera with the fast sampling of the PMT, it is possible to perform 3D tracking with head-tail capability and particle identification down to O(keV) energy. The ERC project INITIUM, in synergy with CYGNO, aims to develop negative ion drift operations within the CYGNO 3D optic approach. 

The latest detector developed by the collaboration is the LIME prototype with a 33x33 cm$^2$ readout area and a drift length of 50 cm, for a total of 50 l active volume. In the presentation, we will illustrate the results of the overground commissioning of LIME with several X-ray sources, demonstrating a linear energy response of the detector between 3.5 and 35 keV with 13\% energy resolution in the whole volume. We will furthermore discuss the development of the MC simulation of sCMOS images, and the very good data/MC agreement obtained between these and the X-ray data. We will then show, exploiting simulated data, the ability to reconstruct the direction of low energy electron recoil. This would set the basis to develop a solar neutrino detection feasibility study. We will finally present the LIME underground installation, operation, and data taking at LNGS, concluding with the prospects and the technical choices for the 0.4 m$^3$ demonstrator. The demonstrator will be the basic detector to study the scalability of our technique towards the O(30) m$^3$ experiment, which can provide a significant contribution to DM searches. In the context of the CYGNUS proto-collaboration, we aim to develop at international level the Galactic Nuclear Recoil Observatory, a ton scale detector with directional sensitivity.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, in person"
regina.caputo@nasa.gov,Regina,Caputo,NASA GSFC,,,,,3A,1,Thu 1.12.,0030,Indirect dark matter searches with future space based gamma-ray telescopes,"The era of precision cosmology has revealed that ~85% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. Two leading candidates are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and weakly interacting sub-eV particles (WISPs) like axions and axionlike particles. Both WIMPs and WISPs possess distinct gamma-ray signatures. Data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) continues to be an integral part of the search for these dark matter signatures spanning the 50 MeV to >300 GeV energy range in a variety of astrophysical targets.  Thus far, there are no conclusive detections; yet, there is an intriguing excess of gamma rays associated with the Galactic center that could be explained with WIMP annihilation. The angular resolution of the LAT at lower energies makes source selection challenging and the true nature of the detected signal remains unknown.  WISP searches using, e.g. supernova explosions, spectra of blazars, or strongly magnetized environments, would also greatly benefit from increased angular and energy resolution, as well as from polarization measurements.  Future gamma-ray telescopes will have the ability to address some of these issues and those will be discussed in this talk. These instruments will allow us to explore new areas of dark matter parameter space and provide unprecedented access to its particle nature.","Indirect Detection, Invited talk, online"

keir.rogers@utoronto.ca,Keir,Rogers,University of Toronto,,,,,3B,1,Thu 1.12.,0300,Identifying the fundamental nature of dark matter in the cosmic large-scale structure,"The fundamental nature of dark matter so far eludes direct detection experiments, but it has left its imprint in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. Extracting this information requires accurate modelling of structure formation and careful handling of astrophysical uncertainties. I will present new bounds using the LSS on two compelling dark matter scenarios that are otherwise beyond the reach of direct detection today. Ultra-light axion dark matter, particles with very low mass (< 10^-19 eV) and astrophysically-sized wavelengths (> kpc), is produced in high-energy models like string theory (“axiverse”). I will rule out axions that are proposed to resolve the so-called cold dark matter “small-scale crisis” (mass ~ 10^-22 eV) using the Lyman-alpha forest (a spectroscopic probe of the intergalactic medium). Further, I will demonstrate how a mixed axion dark matter model (as produced in the string axiverse) could resolve the S_8 cosmological parameter tension (mass ~ 10^-26 eV) using Planck, ACT and SPT cosmic microwave background and BOSS galaxy survey data. I will set the strongest limits to-date on the dark matter — proton cross section for dark matter particles lighter than a proton (mass < GeV). The LSS model involves cosmic perturbation theory, a non-cold dark matter halo model and, to capture the smallest scales, a machine learning model called an “emulator”, trained using hydrodynamical simulations and an active learning technique called Bayesian optimisation.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Contributed talk, online"
daneng.yang.pku@gmail.com,Daneng,Yang,"University of California, Riverside",,,,,3B,2,Thu 1.12.,0315,A graph model for the clustering of dark matter halos,"We use network theory to study hierarchical clustering of dark matter halos, the building blocks of cosmic structure. We analyze cosmological simulations of structure formation, which are publicly available, and construct tree graphs for individual main halo systems by connecting their associated subhalos. These graphs exhibit a power-law degree distribution with an exponent of $-2$. We propose a growing graph model based on preferential attachment to realize the power-law distribution exhibited in the simulations. The attachment kernel effectively incorporates effects of minor mergers, major mergers and tidal stripping. The model reproduces many important features of the simulated halos, including the subhalo abundance and the hierarchical clustering. It provides a new way of modeling complex gravitational dynamics of structure formation.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Contributed talk, online"
kaneda@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,Yuka,Kaneda,University of Tsukuba,,,,,3B,3,Thu 1.12.,0330,The effect of the cusp-to-core transformation on universal scaling relations of dark matter haloes,"The standard Λcold dark matter cosmological model remarkably describes the structure formation of the universe on large scale. However, on smaller scales including the dark matter (DM) haloes of galaxies and dwarf galaxies, there have been longstanding tensions. The oldest one is the ‘cusp–core’ problem. Besides, observations have revealed the existence of interesting universal properties of DM haloes, called ‘scaling relations’, especially around low-mass galaxies. Thus far, the origin of these relations is still an open question.
In this work, we investigate the origin of the observational scaling relations in relation to the cusp-core problem. First, we show the comparison between the observations and the concentration-mass relation (c-M relation), which is a prediction for the universality of the DM haloes given by cosmological N-body simulations, on c_{200}-M_{200} plane, \rho_s-r_s plane, and r_{max}-V_{max} plane. Then, standing on a hypothesis that DM haloes are formed primarily with central cusps and then some kind of dynamical processes lead them to form cores, we provide a ‘core-to-cusp transformation model’ that reverts the cored profile back to the cusp profile without considering detailed physics. Using this model, we revert the scaling relations into cusp profile and compare them with the c-M relation. We find that the reverted scaling relations show nice agreement with the c-M relation. These results suggest that the c-M relation is the origin of the scaling relations and that the cusp-to-core transformation has taken place.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Contributed talk, in person"

sven.poder@kbfi.ee,Sven,Põder,National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics,,,,,3B,5,Thu 1.12.,0400,Searching for Dark Matter Subhalos in the Milky Way using Deep Learning,"The search for dark matter (DM) has grown into an endeavour spanning many orders of magnitude in terms of the potential particle candidate masses probed by numerous direct and indirect experiments. A potentially new avenue to explore the nature of DM is to test the predicted abundance of dark subhalos in the LCDM framework. According to contemporary theories of structure formation, our Galaxy has grown by mergers with smaller halos from which we expect a large population of subhalos orbiting galaxies. Since the abundance of these subhalos is dependent on the particular DM model, setting constraints on the Galactic subhalo mass function would provide us valuable information about the particle nature of DM. Because DM halos on sub galactic scales do not host any stars and remain dark, their detection is not a trivial task as we are left to assume their presence from the kinematics of stars. With this in mind, the dramatic increase in high-precision observations from current and future stellar surveys of our Galaxy (e.g. Gaia satellite, 4MOST) encourages us to employ deep learning methods to detect subhalos gravitationally. Motivated by the above, our work estimates the feasibility of using deep learning methods on simulations and synthetic Gaia observations to detect stellar phase-space disturbances induced by orbiting dark matter subhalos. We quantify the magnitude of these perturbations using a deep learning based anomaly detection algorithm.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Contributed talk, online"

Using the latest Planck data release, for the first time we use microwave synchrotron polarization to constrain Dark Matter annihilation in the Galaxy. We find that polarization is more constraining than synchrotron intensity by about one order of magnitude, independently from uncertainties in the modeling of electron and positron propagation and the model of Galactic magnetic field.
We discuss prospects for using Planck polarization data to constrain further exotic electron and positron injections in the Galaxy, and possible improvements in modeling the background emissions.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Contributed talk, online"

Among these cooks are those searching for dark matter with very high energy gamma-rays interacting with the Earth atmosphere and later on detected  via  radiation or particles thereafter generated.

akio.kawasaki@aist.go.jp,Akio,Kawasaki,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,,,,,3C,2,Thu 1.12.,0710,Dark Matter Searches with Quantum Measurements,"Recent development in quantum technologies enabled various manipulations and measurements of quantum states ranging from a single atom to macroscopic objects. Because quantum regime is with minimal amount of classical noises, they are suitable for precision measurements. Such precise measurements are sensitive to faint couplings between ordinary matter and dark matter, and therefore quantum measurements are utilized for dark matter searches.

In this talk, as examples of such dark matter searches, I will introduce ongoing experimental efforts on three different systems: superconducting qubits, high-Q mechanical oscillators, and ultracold Yb atomic gas. These systems are sensitive to not only classically well-known dark matter candidates, such as axions and WIMPs, but also some less commonly investigated mass range, e.g., ultralight dark matter and kg-scale particles, and capable of searching for new parameter spaces.","Light Dark Matter, Invited talk, in person"

o.a.maciasramirez@uva.nl,Oscar,Macias,University of Amsterdam,,,,,3D,2,Thu 1.12.,0900,Gamma-ray emission from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy due to millisecond pulsars,"The Fermi bubbles are giant, γ-ray-emitting lobes emanating from the nucleus of the Milky Way discovered in ~1–100 GeV data collected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Previous work has revealed substructure within the Fermi bubbles that has been interpreted as a signature of collimated outflows from the Galaxy’s supermassive black hole. Here we show via a spatial template analysis that much of the γ-ray emission associated with the brightest region of substructure—the so-called cocoon—is probably due to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This large Milky Way satellite is viewed through the Fermi bubbles from the position of the Solar System. As a tidally and ram-pressure stripped remnant, the Sagittarius dSph has no ongoing star formation, but we nevertheless demonstrate that the dwarf’s millisecond pulsar population can plausibly supply the γ-ray signal that our analysis associates with its stellar template. The measured spectrum is naturally explained by inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by high-energy electron–positron pairs injected by millisecond pulsars belonging to the Sagittarius dSph, combined with these objects’ magnetospheric emission. This finding plausibly suggests that millisecond pulsars produce significant γ-ray emission among old stellar populations, potentially confounding indirect dark-matter searches in regions such as the Galactic Centre, the Andromeda galaxy and other massive Milky Way dSphs.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, online"
eckner@lapth.cnrs.fr,Christopher,Eckner,"LAPP, CNRS",,,,,3D,3,Thu 1.12.,0915,Mind the gap: finding (or not) dark matter in gamma-ray images of the Galactic center with computer vision,"More than a decade has passed since a GeV gamma-ray excess in Fermi-LAT data above well-known astrophysical backgrounds has been detected in the Galactic center region. The origin of this Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains elusive. The leading hypotheses explaining its nature are a population of faint and unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs) or dark matter (DM) annihilation. We use DeepEnsemble Networks (DENs) to perform a detailed gamma-ray analysis of this region to decompose the gamma-ray sky in the Galactic center and investigate the composition of the GCE. We train our networks on simulated data based on templates of background and GCE emission, which is modeled as a combination of DM annihilation and faint MSPs. To gauge the robustness of our predictions, we pay special attention to the so-called 'reality gap' - the difficulty of transferring simulated experience into the real world. We address the reality gap by repeating the analysis using two sets of three nested model spaces of gradually increased complexity. In this talk, we report the results of our study. We find that DENs can robustly detect the background components and the GCE in all model iterations while the predicted emission associated to the background components is consistent with the outcome of a traditional likelihood analysis. However, the re-constructed composition of the GCE is model-dependent. It is likely biased by the presence of a reality gap. We assess the severity of such a gap with the One-Class Deep Support Vector Data Description algorithm for each model instance, which we find to be persistent in all iterations. Our work clearly demonstrates the limitations of analyses aiming at characterizing the GCE's nature as soon as a reality gap is an intrinsic issue. This statement may extend to all previous studies where the reality gap was not explicitly closed.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, online"
fischer@astro.uni-tuebingen.de,Simon,Fischer,University of Tübingen,,,,,3D,4,Thu 1.12.,0930,Twenty years of Dark Matter Searches with INTEGRAL/SPI,"Based on almost 20 years of data collected by the high-resolution spectrometer SPI on board the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) we present constraints on a decaying dark matter particle manifesting itself via a narrow line-like spectral feature. Our ON-OFF type analysis of the Milky Way obser- vations allowed us to constrain the lifetime to be ≳ 10^20 − 10^21 s for DM particles with masses in the range of 40 keV to 14 MeV. Within this mass range our analysis also reveals 32 line-like features detected at ⩾ 3σ significance, 29 of which coincide with known instrumental and astrophysical lines. In particular, we report on the detection of the electron-positron annihilation (511 keV) and 26Al (1809 keV) lines with spatial profiles consistent with previous results in the literature. For the particular case of the sterile neutrino DM we report the limits on the mixing angle as a function of sterile neutrino mass. We discuss the strong impact of systematic uncertainties connected to the strongly time-variable INTEGRAL/SPI instrumental background as well as the ones connected to the uncertainties of MW DM density profile measurements on the derived results.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, in person"
takdg123@gmail.com,Donggeun,Tak,Seoul National University        ,,,,,3D,5,Thu 1.12.,0945,Indirect ultra-heavy dark matter searches with the current and future VHE obervatories,"In the current cosmological paradigm, Dark Matter (DM) constitutes a large portion (about 27 %) of the mass and energy content of the Universe. Self-annihilation and/or decay of DMs may produce various secondary particles, producing very-high-energy gamma rays (VHE; above 100 GeV). The signature of the DM signal has been searched with state-of-art observatories, but it has not been successful. This lack of success proposes a new parameter range, ultra-heavy DM (UHDM). In this talk, I will summarize the dark matter searches with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) result, and explore the feasibility of detecting the annihilation signature for UHDM with current and future VHE gamma-ray observatories. Finally, I will present the result of the UHDM search with VERITAS.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, online"
elisa.ferreira@ipmu.jp,Elisa,Ferreira,Kavli IPMU,,,,,4A,1,Fri 2.12.,0030,Ultra-light dark matter: the light and fuzzy side of dark matter,"Among the many possible candidates for the nature of dark matter, one of the most well-motivated class of models and leading candidate is the ultra-light dark matter.  This class represents the lightest possible dark matter candidates, and exhibits a wave-like behavior on galactic scales. This leads to a rich phenomenology on small scales that can potentially not only reconcile the CDM picture with the small scale behavior of dark matter, but offer us the unique possibility to probe their distinctive predictions, and imprints that can reveal clues about the internal properties of dark matter. In this talk, I will review this class of models, describing and classifying the different constructions and their phenomenology. I will give special attention to the fuzzy dark matter, which is the most studied of these models. Given their vast cosmological and astrophysical effects on observables, I will describe the ongoing advances in constraining these models using current gravitational tests, and highlight the strong constraining power of small scale astrophysical observations. I will show the latest constraints and how with this we are narrowing down the mass range available for these models but also discuss some incompatibilities present in these bounds.","Light Dark Matter, Invited talk, online"

We find that JUNO will be able to give severe constraints on the cross section of DM annihilating into neutrinos and on the lifetime of DM decaying into neutrinos. More concretely, with 20 years of data-taking in the fiducial volume 17 kton, the cross section will be constrained smaller than 4×10−26cm3sec−1 for the mass of a DM particle 15MeV≲mχ≲50MeV at 90% C.L., which might be strong enough to test thermal production mechanism of DM particles for such range of DM mass. The lifetime will be constrained as strong as 1×1024sec for the mass of a DM particle mχ≃100MeV at 90% C.L..","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, in person"

DM-originated antideuteron fluxes can exceed the astrophysical background flux by more than two orders of magnitude, especially in the low-energy range below 1 GeV/nucleon. The General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a unique balloon-borne instrument to measure low-energy cosmic antinuclei below 0.25 GeV/nucleon. GAPS employs a novel particle identification technique that uses the creation of exotic atoms and their subsequent deexcitation X-rays and nuclear annihilation products to identify antinuclei. The integration of the GAPS payload including gondola, Si:Li detector tracker, time-of-flight detector, electronics, cooling system, etc. is ongoing. In this talk, I will review the GAPS capabilities and the current status of the GAPS experiment.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, in person"

benvlehmann@gmail.com,Benjamin,Lehmann,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,,,,,4B,2,Fri 2.12.,0230,Direct detection with superconducting nanowires,"Superconducting nanowires, a mature technology originally developed for quantum sensing, can be used as a target and sensor with which to search for dark matter interactions with electrons. We leverage recent developments in the theory of dark matter interactions in dielectrics to robustly predict the event rate in a nanowire device, fully accounting for the many-body physics of the detector. As a proof of concept, we use data from a 180-hour measurement of a prototype device to place new constraints on dark matter--electron interactions, including the strongest terrestrial constraints to date on sub-MeV (sub-eV) dark matter that interacts with electrons via scattering (absorption) processes. We present a roadmap for the development of future experiments and demonstrate the prospects for superconducting nanowires to lead exploration of the light dark matter parameter space.","Light Dark Matter, Contributed talk, online"

In particular, it does not include gravity and does not explain dark matter. In this talk, we will discuss a new technique to search for dark matter in the galactic halo with optical cavities and quantum light. The experiment probes a parameter regime that is inaccessible to other state-of-the-art experiments, such as ADMX, and will be a part of an international network for axion searches. I will show the preliminary experimental results and discuss future directions, including scaling the detector to km length.","Light Dark Matter, Contributed talk, in person"
hiroki.fujimoto@phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,Hiroki,Fujimoto,"Department of Physics, University of Tokyo",,,,,4B,5,Fri 2.12.,0315,Latest Status and Sensitivity of DANCE: Dark matter Axion search with riNg Cavity Experiment,"Axion-like particles (ALPs) are undiscovered particles that are well-motivated candidates for ultralight dark matter. Dark matter Axion search with riNg Cavity Experiment (DANCE) aims to detect the ALP dark matter using laser interferometric techniques, which are also used in laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors.
The interaction between ALPs and photons slightly causes the rotational oscillation of linearly polarized light, and therefore ALP dark matter can be detected by the measurement of the polarization rotation of a laser beam. DANCE amplifies the rotational angle and its sensitivity to ALP dark matter by circulating a linear polarization in a bow-tie optical ring cavity. The target sensitivity of DANCE is several orders of magnitude better than the current upper limit on the axion-photon coupling constant in the mass range below 10^{-12} eV.
Currently, the tabletop prototype experiment: DANCE Act-1 is ongoing. In the previous work, we have assembled the bow-tie ring cavity and the auxiliary cavity for simultaneous resonance of orthogonal linear polarizations and have conducted test operations. In this presentation, we will report on the further improvements in the optical system and the achieved sensitivity.","Light Dark Matter, Contributed talk, in person"
sadachi5@gmail.com,Shunsuke,Adachi,Kyoto University,,,,,4B,6,Fri 2.12.,0330,DOSUE-RR - Dark-photon dark-matter search at Kyoto,"Dark photon is one of the dark matter candidates. A kinetic mixing with the electromagnetic field with a coupling constant χ allows us to detect the dark photon. It converts into ordinary photons on an electromagnetic boundary, e.g., a surface of a metal plate. The conversion photons have a specific frequency corresponding to the mass of dark photons. Our experiment, DOSUE-RR, aims to detect the dark photon dark matter in the mass range of 0.04--1.1 meV/c2 which corresponds to the frequency of the conversion photons from 10 GHz to 260 GHz. 
We already achieved to explore the frequency range from 18.0 to 26.5 GHz using a cryogenic millimeter-wave receiver. We found no significant signal excess in this search, and we set the most stringent limit to date: χ < (0.2--1.1)×10-10, which is tighter than that by cosmological observations. For stepping forward to the higher frequency region, we are constructing a new receiver. In this presentation, we will report our first results as well as our near-term plans.","Light Dark Matter, Contributed talk, in person"
