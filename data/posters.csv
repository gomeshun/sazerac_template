Dark photon, one of the CDM candidates, is predicted to be converted to the ordinary photon at the boundary of the electromagnetic field. DOSUE-RR is a series of experiments, which aims to detect the conversion photon in the millimeter-wave range. Our secondary instrument is designed to detect the conversion photon in the frequency range of 10 - 18 GHz (J-band), corresponding dark photon mass range of 40 - 75 ueV. The conversion rate depends on the arrival direction and polarization of the dark photons as well as the coupling constraint to photons. In addition to the dark photon mass and the coupling constant, we plan to constrain the arrival direction and polarization based on techniques to measure the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. We will simultaneously measure conversion rates in three different directions by using three horn-antennas. The dark photon search will be performed in a radio-tight room for shielding the system from artificial noises such as satellite television signals. In this poster, we will present the design and development status of our J-band system.",Indirect Detection

Based on the latest cosmological simulation, Phi4096 simulated by Ishiyama et al. (2021), we investigate the evolution of satellite dark matter halos associated with Milky-Way-sized dark matter halos. The results clearly show that the mass evolution of subhalos has mostly two phases: the accretion phase and the stripping phase, while previous studies show that massive halos experience only accretion phase or a little stripping phase. In addition, more than 90% of subhalos increase their mass gradually until the redshift z=1-2. Then, the mass decreases due to the tidal stripping driven by the host halo. Therefore, it is extracted that the tidal stripping serve a vital role in the evolution of the sub galactic dark matter halos. We will also report the interesting feature of such subhalos’ evolution on the r_max-V_max plane, where r_max is the radius of maximum circular velocity and V_max is the maximum circular velocity.

It is an open question to clarify the formation of these galaxies in the dark-matter-dominated universe. We investigated the galaxy formations through dark matter subhalo (DMSHs) collisions using a simple analysis and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. As a result, we derive critical collision-velocities for the bifurcation sequence of the formation of dark-matter-dominated galaxies and dark-matter-deficient galaxies. In the case of low-speed collisions, a merger of the two DMSHs produces dark-matter-dominated galaxies. However, the two DMSHs penetrate each other, but the gaseous mediums collide for the middle-speed encounter. The enhancement of the gas density induces a burst of star formation, and then a dwarf galaxy without a dark matter halo forms at the interface of the DMSH collision. In this poster, we report the effect of the gas metallicity in the subhalo and discuss the possibility of the formation of dark-matter-deficient galaxies comparing the simulation results and observations.",DM Astrophysics
,g.sato@astr.tohoku.ac.jp,Genta Sato,Tohoku University,,,,The global dynamical distribution of the Milky Way's metal-poor stars,"We analyze the dynamical distribution of the Milky Way (MW)'s stellar halo and a subcomponent, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). The method to reconstruct the global distribution is to superpose the stellar orbits to cover a large region. We adopt the stellar data from Gaia EDR3 and SDSS DR16 catalog as dynamical and photometric data, respectively. The selection condition to extract stellar halo data bases on the metallicity, [Fe/H] < -1. We obtain the result that the density distribution of more metal-rich stars forms more flattened shape. Furthermore, the velocity distribution in relatively metal-rich stars, -1.2 < [Fe/H] < -1.0, only forms disk-like structure with strong rotation, which is considered the metal-weak-thick-disk (MWTD). Our result of the relationship between the stellar metallicity and the shape of the halo is consistent with the galaxy formation model in CDM literature. On the other hand, the density distribution of GSE-like subsample creates an outer ridge at Galactocentric radius r ~ 20 kpc for -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.0, which is consistent with GSE's metallicity range. The ridge may show that the GSE's progenitor has an apocenter of ~ 20 kpc.",Indirect Detection

Equipped with a 21m diameter collector, the MACE exhibits a lower energy threshold of ~ 20GeV and an excellent sensitivity up to 150 GeV. The telescope recently had its first from the standard candle Crab Nebula and is now entering into its science operation phase. Because of its lower energy threshold, better sensitivity and unique
geographical location, the MACE telescope is expected to make a very
significant contribution in the indirect detection of gamma-ray signal produced
by the interaction of the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the
astrophysical environments. In this contribution, we present the results from a
feasibility study for searching the gamma-ray signal from a few nearby galaxy
clusters using the MACE telescope. We have used Pythia simulation package
for calculating the gamma-ray flux produced from the self annihilation or decay
of WIMPs into the standard model particles. We also estimate the minimum
time required for the MACE telescope to detect statistically significant gamma-
ray signal from the selected sites of the WIMPs dark matter candidate.",Indirect Detection

We compare microlensing effects caused by point masses (Schwarzschild lenses) and extended clumps of matter using a simple model for the lens mapping. A superposition of the point mass and the extended clump is also considered. For special choices of the parameters, this model may represent a cusped clump of cold DM, a cored clump of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) or an ultra-compact minihalo of DM surrounding a massive point-like object. We use data from Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to verify the deflection as predicted by General relativity. An example of such deviation described by a simple power law is analyzed by considering small deviations and constraining those from the observations. By considering about a thousand microlensing light curves we conclude that there is no evidence of a contradiction with the General Relativity within 1 per cent uncertainty.",DM Astrophysics
,michael.zantedeschi1@gmail.com,Michael Zantedeschi,"Max-Planck Institute for Physics, Munich",,,,Primordial Black Holes from Confinement,"A mechanism for the formation of primordial black holes is proposed. Here, heavy quarks of a confining gauge theory produced by de Sitter fluctuations are pushed apart by inflation and get confined after horizon re-entry. The large amount of energy stored in the colour flux tubes connecting the quark pair leads to black-hole formation. These are much lighter and can be of higher spin than those produced by standard collapse of horizon-size inflationary overdensities. Other difficulties exhibited by such mechanisms are also avoided. Phenomenological features of the new mechanism are discussed as well as accounting for both the entirety of the dark matter and the supermassive black holes in the galactic centres. Under proper conditions, the mechanism can be realised in a generic confinement theory, including ordinary QCD. Interestingly, for certain values of the string scale, the produced gravity waves are within the range of recent NANOGrav events. Simple generalisations of the mechanism allow for the existence of a significant scalar component of gravity waves with distinct observational signatures.","DM Theory, Primordial Black Holes"

The mass and spin are fundamental properties of a black hole, and they can substantially affect the evaporation rate of the black hole. The evaporating black hole can inject energy into the intergalactic medium and heat the gas. Subsequently, it can modify the absorption in the global 21 cm signal. Therefore, the absorption feature in the 21 cm signal can provide a robust bound on primordial black holes.",Primordial Black Holes

Models that extend minimal scenarios by introducing other degrees of freedom are well motivated ways to go beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this talk, I will focus on the light dark Higgs portal that connects the dark sector consisting of, e.g., TeV-scale secluded dark matter (DM) with the SM. I will illustrate the phenomenology of this model, focusing on the signatures of DM and long-lived particles (LLP) in complementary experimental searches. These include i) the intensity frontier searches for light new physics, ii) indirect detection (ID) of secluded WIMPs, and iii) future CMB radiation surveys. Finally, I will highlight the important role of non-local effects present in the ID of LLPs which significantly affects the detection strategies, usually tailored to WIMPs. These effects include a) an additional contribution to the photon flux due to the ""GC diffusion"" effect, b) a linear flux decrease in the long-lived regime due to finite DM density support, and c) a faster flux decrease with LLP decay length for observations focused on small regions of interest, compared to large ones.

We examine the prospect of an idealised gigaton detector like IceCube/KM3Net in probing such scenarios. Within this framework, we report an improved reach in spin-dependent and spin-independent dark matter nucleon cross-section below the current limits for dark matter masses in the TeV-PeV range.","DM Theory, Indirect Detection, DM Astrophysics"
,chakraborti@lapth.cnrs.fr,Sreemanti Chakraborti,"LAPTh, Annecy",,,,Breit-Wigner Enhancement in the Interactions of a Light Scalar Dark Matter,"We study a minimal model for light scalar dark matter (DM) which requires a light scalar mediator to address the core-cusp problem as well as interact with the standard model. We focus on the Breit-Wigner resonance for the DM annihilation and self-scattering channels. The thermally-averaged annihilation cross section of DM has strong temperature dependence, whereas its energy exchange by elastic scattering with the thermal bath particles is suppressed. This leads to the early kinetic decoupling of DM and modifies the standard calculation of relic density. A systematic analysis of the model is done involving the latest and future constraints. In particular, we address, for the first time, the indirect search prospects of the sub-GeV scalar mediator by studying the photon spectra. The near-future experiments and observations such as low-mass direct detections, indirect detections and the CMB observations are shown to play important roles to test the model.","DM Theory, Indirect Detection"

,ynkym@icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp,Yuhei Nakayama,"UTokyo, ICRR",,,,Cosmological Constraint on Dark Scalar from CMB Neff,"Recently dark matter theories based on the dark sectors have attracted the attention of many people. These often contain MeV-scale mediators, which induce portal interactions with the standard model particles. One of the simplest examples of such a mediator is a dark scalar which couples to the standard model particles via the so-called Higgs portal.
In general, light mediators are produced thermally and affect the various cosmology. Especially, BSM particles decaying around  T = O(1) MeV alter the effective number of neutrino species, Neff, at recoupling era. We compute the thermal evolution of the dark scalar and estimate the CMB Neff numerically. Due to the hierarchy of the yukawa coupling, the resultant constraints strongly depend on the reheating temperature and whether the self-interaction of the dark scalar exists or not.",DM Theory

The presence of an in-built $Z_2$ symmetry under which the right handed singlet fermions and $\eta$ are odd, gives rise to a stable dark matter candidate along with light neutrino mass in a scotogenic fashion. In spite of the possibility of having positive and negative contributions to  muon and electron $(g-2)$ respectively from vector boson and charged scalar loops, the minimal scotogenic $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ model can not explain both muon and electron $(g-2)$ simultaneously while being consistent with other experimental bounds. We then extend the model with a vector like lepton doublet which not only leads to a chirally enhanced negative contribution to electron $(g-2)$ but also leads to the popular singlet-doublet fermion dark matter scenario. With this extension, the model can explain both electron and muon $(g-2)$ while being consistent with neutrino mass, dark matter and other direct search bounds.",DM Theory
,ph18resch11007@iith.ac.in,Manoranjan Dutta,Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad,,,,Self-interacting Dark Matter via Right Handed Neutrino Portal,"We propose a self-interacting dark matter (DM) scenario with right handed neutrino (RHN)
portal to the standard model (SM). The dark sector consists of a particle DM, assumed to be a Dirac fermion, and a light mediator in terms of a dark Abelian vector boson to give rise to the required velocity dependent self-interactions in agreement with astrophysical observations. Irrespective of thermal or non-thermal production of such a DM, its final relic remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation rates of DM into light mediators by virtue of large self-interaction coupling. We then show that a feeble portal of DM-SM interaction via RHN offers a possibility to fill the relic deficit of DM via the late decay of RHN. As RHN also arises naturally in seesaw models explaining the origin of light neutrino masses, we outline two UV complete realizations of the minimal setup in terms of scotogenic and gauged B - L frameworks where connection to neutrino mass and other
phenomenology like complementary discovery prospects are discussed.",DM Theory

,motz@aoni.waseda.jp,Holger Motz,Waseda University,,,,Extending Dark Matter Limits from Electron and Positron Cosmic Rays to the TeV-region,"Annihilation or decay of dark matter (DM) could produce signatures in the positron and electron cosmic-ray spectra, thus the parameter space of DM candidate models can be probed by studying these messengers. The signature's location in energy is closely correlated with the DM mass, making the TeV-range of these spectra most important for studying heavy DM beyond the WIMP paradigm.     
The performed research aims at extending the limits on DM annihilation and decay rates based on a combined analysis of the all-electron and positron-only cosmic-ray spectra measured by CALET and AMS-02 to the TeV mass range. 
The method of deriving limits from the fit quality of a flexible model of the astrophysical background to which the DM signature is added with an increasing scale factor is explained, together with the underlying models of astrophysical cosmic-ray sources and propagation. 
Limits for the generic lepton annihilation/decay channels and meson-lepton channels as a possible signature of topological defects are presented, based on published spectra from CALET (up to 4.8 TeV) and AMS, while the potential for when CALET data up to higher energy becomes available is discussed.",Indirect Detection

Indirect detection is a promising method to search for dark matter, where we try to look at signatures of the dark matter on the astrophysical messengers. 
Some of the best known astrophysical messengers are gamma-rays and neutrinos.
Heavy dark matter with m_{DM}>10^7 GeV leads to higher fluxes in the decaying scenario rather than the annihilating one. In this work we focus on heavy decaying dark matter particles and we revisit the dark matter lifetime bounds placed by the gamma-ray measurements by means of the spectra provided by the recent code HDMSpectra. We provide lifetime limits for dark matter particles with m_{DM}=[10^7−10^{15}] GeV for a set of decay scenarios, where we include the current measurements that provide upper limits on the gamma-ray flux. We also forecast the performance of the future neutrino radio telescopes and compare the limits that they will be able to place with the current ones placed by gamma-ray measurements.",Indirect Detection

The quantum clumps, which are unique structures of FDM, can be seen in halos in cosmological FDM simulations. In this talk, we first provide our analytic model of the projected sub-galactic matter power spectrum originating from quantum clumps in FDM halos. Then we show a result of a comparison between our power spectrum model around the Einstein radius and that measured in the strong lens system SDSS J0252+0039.

,pkk70amq@s.okayama-u.ac.jp,Jing Wang,Okayama University,,,,Dark Matter Search with Coherent Atoms,"  Axion and Dark Photon (DP) have been considered as well-motivated dark matter candidates. Axion was originally introduced as the solution to the Strong CP problem, while DP is a massive vector particle predicted by an extension of the Standard Model. Both particles should experience coupling or mixing with photons, and thus can be used for dark matter direct detection.

   Here a new experimental approach is proposed to search both particles. This approach uses collective and coherent atoms as a target, Axion/DP inducing resonant atomic transition along with signal photon emission to be detected. The key feature of this method is the “coherent amplification”. That is, when the process occurs coherently in an N-atom system, its transition amplitude interferes constructively and the rate becomes proportional to N square instead of N. With such a huge amplification effect, we expect that the experiment may give new opportunities for finding Axion/DP dark matter or constraining their coupling/mixing parameter in the meV mass region.

   In this talk, I will explain this method in more detail and come up with a possible experimental setup.",Direct Detection

In the now observable energy region, a prominent background appears: It features an exponentially rising shape and rates more than two orders of magnitude higher than the flat background above 1 keV. It likely has different origins in different experiments, however, all of them are yet unknown. This background is the main limiting factor for multiple low threshold experiments, encouraging a collaborative search for an explanation. The EXCESS workshop, which took place in June 2021, is a joint effort of 10 experimental collaborations, discussing observations of the low energy background from 12 different measurements in its first iteration. The measurements were taken with cryogenic, CCD and gaseous ionization detectors, above and below ground, at temperatures between 15 mK and room temperature.

,manush@cbs.ac.in,Manush Manju,Center for Excellence in Basic Science,,,,Reconstructing Two Mediator Models at Direct Detection Experiments,"We explore scenarios where a dark matter particle interacts with the Standard Model via one heavy and one light mediator. Such interactions can lead to constructive or destructive interferences depending on the relative sign of couplings in the resulting scattering amplitudes. The recoil rates arising from such interactions exhibit distinct features, which, if seen in the next generation direct detection experiments, may point to definite model space. In order to verify this, we embark on an exercise of reconstructing the parameters of such complex models at current and future direct detection experiments like COSINUS, CRESST-III, and SuperCDMS. We demonstrate the importance of experimental parameters such as resolution, threshold, and exposure in such exercises.

A way to possibly overcome the limitation of the neutrino floor is a directional sensitive approach: one of the most promising techniques for directional detection is nuclear emulsion technology with nanometric resolution. The NEWSdm experiment, located in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy, is based on novel nuclear emulsion acting both as the Weakly Interactive Massive Particle (WIMP) target and as the nanometric-accuracy tracking device. This would provide a powerful method of confirming the Galactic origin of the dark matter, thanks to the cutting-edge technology developed to readout sub-nanometric trajectories. In this talk we discuss the experiment design, its physics potential, the performance achieved in test beam measurements and the near-future plans. After the submission of a Letter of Intent, a new facility for emulsion handling was constructed in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory which is now under commissioning.

,phyhunter2006@gmail.com,Shu-Yu Ho,Korea Institute for Advanced Study,,,,Reshuffled SIMP Dark Matter,"In this talk, we reanalyze the multi-component strongly interacting massive particle (mSIMP) scenario using an effective operator approach. As in the single-component SIMP case, the total relic abundance of mSIMP dark matter (DM) is determined by the coupling strengths of 3 to 2 processes achieved by a five-point effective operator. Intriguingly, we find that there is an unavoidable 2 to 2 process induced by the corresponding five-point interaction in the dark sector, which would reshuffle the mass densities of SIMP DM after the chemical freeze-out. We dub this DM scenario as reshuffled SIMP (rSIMP). Given this observation, we then numerically solve the coupled Boltzmann equations including the 3 to 2 and 2 to 2 processes to get the correct yields of rSIMP DM. It turns out that the masses of rSIMP DM must be nearly degenerate for them to contribute sizable abundances. On the other hand, we also introduce effective operators to bridge the dark sector and visible sector via a vector portal coupling. Since the signal strength of detecting DM is proportional to the individual densities; thereby, obtaining the right amount of DM particles is crucial in the rSIMP scenario. ",DM Theory
