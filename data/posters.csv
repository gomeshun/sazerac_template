Djuvsland,Inverse Compton emission from heavy WIMP annihilations in the Galactic Centre,University of Bergen,https://dm2022kashiwa.slack.com/archives/C04BLRSPTP0,,,In gamma-ray analyses often only the direct photon component is considered as signal when searching for annihilating WIMPS. This means that only photons that are produced during the WIMP annihilation and the consecutive hadronisation are taken into account. There is however also a non-negligible contribution to the gamma-ray signal that arises from the electrons that are produced in the annihilation. They can enhance the WIMP signal through high energy photons produced in Inverse Compoton processes by these electrons. In this poster we want to highlight this contribution as expected in the Galactic Centre region and encourage people to account for this component when searching for WIMP annihilation using gamma-rays.,"Indirect Detection, Room 1, Poster 1",,,,,

In this work, we present the current constraints on dark matter densities in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Milky Way. Applying our constructed non-spherical mass models to the currently available kinematic data of the satellites, we find that several ultra-faint dwarf galaxies favor cusped central profiles. We compare our results with the simulated subhalos on the plane between the dark matter density at 150pc and the pericenter distance. We find that the most observed satellites and the simulated subhalos are similarly distributed on this plane, except for Antlia2, Crater2, and Tucana3 which deviate considerably from the simulated ones. Despite considering tidal effects, the subhalos detected by commonly-used subhalo finders can be difficult to explain such a huge deviation.","Indirect Detection, Astrophysics and Cosmology, Room 1, Poster 2",,,,,

The Galactic Centre region is expected to host the closest dark matter halo of considerable size and is therefore well suited for this kind of searches. Observations at large zenith angles improve sensitivity for gamma-rays in the TeV regime due to the increased telescope collection area. We present the results obtained with more than 200 hours of large-zenith angle observations of the Galactic Centre region, which allow us to obtain competitive limits to the dark matter annihilation cross-section at high particle masses (<5E-28 cm^3 s^-1 at 1 TeV and <1E-25 cm^3 s^-1 at 100 TeV), improving the best current constraints above 20 TeV. In addition, we also study the impact of an inner cored dark matter halo on probing the annihilation cross-section.

Nuclearites and strange quark matters(SQM) are hypothetical super-heavy macroscopic particles (macros), and may be important components of the dark matter in our Universe. Their galactic origins would have an expected typical velocity of about 220 km/s in galactic frame, whereas in the case of a head-on collision between interstellar meteoroids with a velocity that exceeds the escape velocity of the solar system and the Earth orbiting the Sun, the geocentric velocities will be larger than 72 km/s. We study the possibility to search for such fast-moving particles by using very high-sensitivity CMOS cameras with a wide field of view. Based on observational data of meteor events using such stereo camera systems at some locations, we estimate the observable mass ranges for the moving macros and the interstellar meteoroids. Observable flux limits are also estimated for these mass ranges.
We designed the DIMS experiment to search for such particles. The DIMS system consists of 5 high-sensitivity CMOS camera stations with a wide field of view. At present 3 stations are set at the central area in Japan and 2 stations at the Telescope Array cosmic-ray-experiment site in Utah, USA.

It has been shown that using the correlated information between the dark matter distribution in the Universe with the fluctuations of the cosmic radiation fields has the potential to allow setting apart a pure dark matter signal from astrophysical emissions, since spatial fluctuations in the radiation field due to astrophysical sources and dark matter emission have different features. The cross-correlation technique has been proposed and adopted for dark matter studies by looking at dark matter halos (over-densities). In this paper we extend the technique by focusing on the information on dark matter distribution offered by cosmic voids, and by looking specifically at the gamma-ray dark matter emission: we show that, while being under-dense and therefore producing a reduced emission as compared to halos, nevertheless in voids the relative size of the cross-correlation signal due to decaying dark matter vs. astrophysical sources is significantly more favourable, producing signal-to-background ratios S/B (even significantly) larger than 1 for decay lifetimes up to 2 × 1030 s. This is at variance with the case of halos, where S/B is typically (even much) smaller than 1. We show that forthcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid combined with future generation gamma-ray detectors with improved specifications have the ability to provide a hint of such a signal with a predicted significance up to 4.2σ for galaxies and 2.7σ for the cosmic shear. The bound on the dark matter lifetime attainable exploiting voids is predicted to improve on current bounds in a mass range for the WIMP of 20 - 200 GeV.","Astrophysics and Cosmology, Room 1, Poster 9",,,,,

Yet, its existence is still debated, and relies on the observations of gravitational effects in large-scale 
structures and in cosmology. One of the most striking types of evidence of unexpected gravitational 
effects come from galaxies, and in particular spiral galaxies. In spiral galaxies, most of the visible mass 
is gathered in the budge and the disc. Using the Gauss’ theorem, the velocity of stars v at the distance.
R from the galactic center reads (FORMULA) 

As a consequence, the velocity is expected to decrease as v(R) ∝ 𝑅^1/2 most of spiral galaxies, however.
the observed velocity far from the center is approximately constant.
The most striking cases are the ones of strong gravitational lensing of distant galaxies behind a galaxy 
cluster, which appear under the form of several distorted images spread on the so-called Einstein circle.
The angular radius of the Einstein circle is related to the mass which gave rise to light deflection through 
the formula. (FORMULA)
Gravitational lensing is therefore often used to weigh galaxy clusters, and numerous studies are 
consistent and tend to demonstrate that the visible mass represents only 10-20% of the total mass, 
similarly, to the commonly found result in galaxies.
In the early universe when Matter starts gathering via gravitational collapse in the denser regions, 
forming large-scale structures in which galaxies also emerge. Two main effects which affected the
structure formations are gravitational interaction attracts matter in the centers of masses, and the 
expansion of the Universe drives structures away from each other. the interplay between expansion and 
gravity and study the role of dark matter in this process is very important. Thus, there are various 
computer simulations which we run to visualize the formation of the universe. The standard 
cosmological model ΛCDM shows a remarkable agreement with all the observations from disparate 
scales. Finally, the combined results of are consistent with the large-scale structure data, and reveal that 
the ratio of baryonic mass over total matter mass is close to 15%, which is in agreement with the results

We find that the analytically derived core-halo mass relations quite resemble those found in early numerical works, but involving the factor dependent crucially on the halo concentration and cosmological parameters.

The kinetic energy of halo light DM is so small that the energy transfer through elastic scattering with nuclei can hardly exceed the detection threshold. In addition to using electron target, one possible way of overcoming this difficulty is fermionic DM absorption. Being converted to a massless neutrino, the light DM releases all its mass into energy for the final-state neutrino and electron. Even O(10)keV DM can already leave large enough electron recoil energy, thanks to the efficient mass conversion to energy. It also gives a unique signal with clear peak in the electron recoil spectrum whose shape is largely determined by the atomic effects. Terrestrial direct detection experiments, such as PandaX-II and Xenon1T, can be sensitive to this absorption signal. In addition, the DM overproduction, its invisible and visible decay effects on the cosmological evolution and the astrophysical X(gamma)-ray are thoroughly explored to give up-to-date constraints. Recently, the PandaX group uses the latest result with 0.63 tonne-year exposure from Panda-4T to put a stringent constraint. The result gives the first DM direct detection probe whose sensitivity already exceeds the indirect ones from astrophysical and cosmological observations, especially in the mass range from 25 to 45 (35 to 50) keV for an axial-vector (vector) interaction, respectively. This talk will elaborate the direct and indirect searches for this unique scenario of fermionic DM absorption on electron targets, including the second quantization treatment of the atomic effects.

The DarkSide Low-Mass and DarkSide 20k experiments (both at LNGS) require respectively 1 t and 50 t of argon to detect WIMPS via their scattering on argon nuclei and represent a fundamental step in the search for dark matter. However, the (_^39)Ar isotope, which is a beta-emitter of cosmogenic origin, poses background and pile-up issues. Therefore, the main purpose of the Aria project is to exploit cryogenic distillation to produce argon with lower concentrations of this isotope for the DarkSide experiments and to eliminate other chemical impurities (mainly N_2, O_2, CH_4, and CO_2) for DarkSide 20k.
The first isotopic distillation of argon with the prototype Seruci-0 took place between November and December 2021, and it was a success, having measured a significant difference between the natural abundances of (_^36)Ar, (_^38)Ar, and (_^40)Ar and those distilled from above and below the prototype column. The measured distillation performance with argon is fully adequate for the purification of impurities via distillation for the DarkSide-20k experiment. In parallel to the experimental results, we carried out several simulations demonstrating the potential of Seruci-1 distillation column to separate UAr from impurities such as N_2, O_2, CH_4, CO_2, etc.
This purification process can be done through two successive passages in Seruci-1 and is expected to match the purity requirements of DarkSide-20k producing 100 t in a reasonable time.","Direct Detection, Room 2, Poster 18",,,,,

We found that, contrary to what was widely thought, domain walls exhibit remarkable stability even when the distribution of the initial fluctuations is slightly biased toward one of the minima. 
Applying this result to the ALP domain wall, we show that not only it explains the isotropic cosmic birefringence suggested by the recent analysis, but also predicts a scale-invariant anisotropic cosmic birefringence at large scales within the reach of future CMB observations such as LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and PICO. It should be emphasized that the scale-invariant anisotropic cosmic birefringence predicted by the axion domain wall with inflationary fluctuations is smaller than that predicted by the axion string, and thus can easily meet the limits from current observations.","DM Theory, Astrophysics and Cosmology, Room 2, Poster 23",,,,,

We point out that contrary to the standard criterion, the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry could remain unbroken during inflation, even when the axion decay constant, $f_a$, is (much) above the inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$. This is achieved through the heavy-lifting of the PQ scalar field due to its leading non-renormalizable interaction with the inflaton, encoded in a high-dimensional operator which respects the approximate shift symmetry of the inflaton. The mechanism opens up a new window for the post-inflationary QCD axion and significantly enlarges the parameter space, in which the QCD axion dark matter with $f_a > H_I$ could be compatible with high-scale inflation and free from constraints on axion isocurvature perturbations. There also exist non-derivative couplings, which still keep the inflaton shift symmetry breaking under control, to achieve the heavy-lifting of the PQ field during inflation. Additionally, by introducing an early matter domination era, more parameter space of high $f_a$ could yield the observed DM abundance.","DM Theory, Light Dark Matter, Room 2, Poster 26",,,,,

Correspondingly, a black hole with extremal spin emerges as a graviton condensate with vorticity. This offers a topological explanation for the stability of extremal black holes against Hawking evaporation.

We numerically solve the set of Boltzmann equations, that governs the cosmological evolution during both radiation and PBH-dominated epochs, providing the bulk energy contents in the early Universe.

The most well-accepted paradigm introduces two unknown components to the standard model that govern the dynamics of the Universe at present times: Dark Energy, proposed as the source for the acceleration, and Dark Matter, needed to make formation of structures in the Universe possible. In this work we focus on a particular framework, the Dark D-Brane model, in which these dark components naturally interact, leaving distinct signatures that can be probed observationally.","DM Theory, Room 2, Poster 30",,,,,

Due to the quantum nature of FDM, the soliton core forms around the center of FDM halos. While the core-halo mass relations are widely studied in the literature, there are no consensus among them. We assume that the FDM density profile can be obtained by the redistribution of CDM density profile due to the quantum nature of FDM, and construct an analytical model for the core-halo mass relation in FDM halos. Through our modeling, we also study the two possible ways to determine the core size called as ""Jeans model"" and ""Relax model"", which are based on the hydrostatic equilibrium condition and the relaxation time condition, respectively. Both of them show a quite good agreement with the averaged core-halo mass relation obtained by the largest cosmological simulation (May et. al., 2021). We predict that the core-halo mass relation is expressed roughly in a double power law unlike the previous papers which predict them as single power laws. We also show that the dispersion of the core-halo mass relations in FDM halos might originate from the dispersion of concentration parameter in the CDM profile.","DM Theory, Room 2, Poster 31",,,,,

We consider phenomenological quantum gravity effects predicted by generalized uncertainty principle with minimal measurable length. We derive corrections of Hawking temperature to general relativity, which are related to energy of emitted particle, Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, charge of black hole and existence of minimal length in the black hole geometry. We obtain some known Hawking temperatures in four-dimensional black hole spacetimes by taking limits in modified temperature. We show that generalized uncertainty principle may slow down the increase of Hawking temperature due to radiation, which may lead to thermodynamic stable remnant of the order of Planck mass after evaporation of four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. Since a Planck mass remnant would be a ground state mass of a black hole, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole remnant would have no hair. This would be a desirable property as a dark matter. If the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet metric would describe the geometry around a primordial black hole and the generalized uncertainty principle considered in this work would play an important role in the quantum nature of the black hole, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole remnants would be a dark matter candidate.","DM Theory, Room 2, Poster 32",,,,,
