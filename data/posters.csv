These often contain MeV-scale mediators, which induce portal interactions with the standard model particles. One of the simplest examples of such a mediator is a dark scalar which couples to the standard model particles via the so-called Higgs portal.
In general, light mediators are produced thermally and affect the various cosmology. Especially, BSM particles decaying around  T = O(1) MeV alter the effective number of neutrino species, Neff, at recoupling era. We compute the thermal evolution of the dark scalar and estimate the CMB Neff numerically. Due to the hierarchy of the yukawa coupling, the resultant constraints strongly depend on the reheating temperature and whether the self-interaction of the dark scalar exists or not.","DM Theory, Poster 1, Room 1",1,,,,,

portal to the standard model (SM). The dark sector consists of a particle DM, assumed to be a Dirac fermion, and a light mediator in terms of a dark Abelian vector boson to give rise to the required velocity dependent self-interactions in agreement with astrophysical observations. Irrespective of thermal or non-thermal production of such a DM, its final relic remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation rates of DM into light mediators by virtue of large self-interaction coupling. We then show that a feeble portal of DM-SM interaction via RHN offers a possibility to fill the relic deficit of DM via the late decay of RHN. As RHN also arises naturally in seesaw models explaining the origin of light neutrino masses, we outline two UV complete realizations of the minimal setup in terms of scotogenic and gauged B - L frameworks where connection to neutrino mass and other
phenomenology like complementary discovery prospects are discussed.","DM Theory, Poster 2, Room 1",3,,,,,

As in the single-component SIMP case, the total relic abundance of mSIMP dark matter (DM) is determined by the coupling strengths of 3 to 2 processes achieved by a five-point effective operator. Intriguingly, we find that there is an unavoidable 2 to 2 process induced by the corresponding five-point interaction in the dark sector, which would reshuffle the mass densities of SIMP DM after the chemical freeze-out. We dub this DM scenario as reshuffled SIMP (rSIMP). Given this observation, we then numerically solve the coupled Boltzmann equations including the 3 to 2 and 2 to 2 processes to get the correct yields of rSIMP DM. It turns out that the masses of rSIMP DM must be nearly degenerate for them to contribute sizable abundances. On the other hand, we also introduce effective operators to bridge the dark sector and visible sector via a vector portal coupling. Since the signal strength of detecting DM is proportional to the individual densities; thereby, obtaining the right amount of DM particles is crucial in the rSIMP scenario.","DM Theory, Poster 4, Room 1",4,,,,,

We focus on the Breit-Wigner resonance for the DM annihilation and self-scattering channels. The thermally-averaged annihilation cross section of DM has strong temperature dependence, whereas its energy exchange by elastic scattering with the thermal bath particles is suppressed. This leads to the early kinetic decoupling of DM and modifies the standard calculation of relic density. A systematic analysis of the model is done involving the latest and future constraints. In particular, we address, for the first time, the indirect search prospects of the sub-GeV scalar mediator by studying the photon spectra. The near-future experiments and observations such as low-mass direct detections, indirect detections and the CMB observations are shown to play important roles to test the model.","DM Theory, Indirect Detection, Poster 6, Room 1",6,,,,,

Models that extend minimal scenarios by introducing other degrees of freedom are well motivated ways to go beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this talk, I will focus on the light dark Higgs portal that connects the dark sector consisting of, e.g., TeV-scale secluded dark matter (DM) with the SM. I will illustrate the phenomenology of this model, focusing on the signatures of DM and long-lived particles (LLP) in complementary experimental searches. These include i) the intensity frontier searches for light new physics, ii) indirect detection (ID) of secluded WIMPs, and iii) future CMB radiation surveys. Finally, I will highlight the important role of non-local effects present in the ID of LLPs which significantly affects the detection strategies, usually tailored to WIMPs. These effects include a) an additional contribution to the photon flux due to the ""GC diffusion"" effect, b) a linear flux decrease in the long-lived regime due to finite DM density support, and c) a faster flux decrease with LLP decay length for observations focused on small regions of interest, compared to large ones.

Based on the latest cosmological simulation, Phi4096 simulated by Ishiyama et al. (2021), we investigate the evolution of satellite dark matter halos associated with Milky-Way-sized dark matter halos. The results clearly show that the mass evolution of subhalos has mostly two phases: the accretion phase and the stripping phase, while previous studies show that massive halos experience only accretion phase or a little stripping phase. In addition, more than 90% of subhalos increase their mass gradually until the redshift z=1-2. Then, the mass decreases due to the tidal stripping driven by the host halo. Therefore, it is extracted that the tidal stripping serve a vital role in the evolution of the sub galactic dark matter halos. We will also report the interesting feature of such subhalos’ evolution on the r_max-V_max plane, where r_max is the radius of maximum circular velocity and V_max is the maximum circular velocity.","DM Astrophysics, Poster 8, Room 1",8,,,,,

It is an open question to clarify the formation of these galaxies in the dark-matter-dominated universe. We investigated the galaxy formations through dark matter subhalo (DMSHs) collisions using a simple analysis and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. As a result, we derive critical collision-velocities for the bifurcation sequence of the formation of dark-matter-dominated galaxies and dark-matter-deficient galaxies. In the case of low-speed collisions, a merger of the two DMSHs produces dark-matter-dominated galaxies. However, the two DMSHs penetrate each other, but the gaseous mediums collide for the middle-speed encounter. The enhancement of the gas density induces a burst of star formation, and then a dwarf galaxy without a dark matter halo forms at the interface of the DMSH collision. In this poster, we report the effect of the gas metallicity in the subhalo and discuss the possibility of the formation of dark-matter-deficient galaxies comparing the simulation results and observations.","DM Astrophysics, Poster 9, Room 1",9,,,,,

We compare microlensing effects caused by point masses (Schwarzschild lenses) and extended clumps of matter using a simple model for the lens mapping. A superposition of the point mass and the extended clump is also considered. For special choices of the parameters, this model may represent a cusped clump of cold DM, a cored clump of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) or an ultra-compact minihalo of DM surrounding a massive point-like object. We use data from Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to verify the deflection as predicted by General relativity. An example of such deviation described by a simple power law is analyzed by considering small deviations and constraining those from the observations. By considering about a thousand microlensing light curves we conclude that there is no evidence of a contradiction with the General Relativity within 1 per cent uncertainty.","DM Astrophysics, Poster 10, Room 1",10,,,,,

The quantum clumps, which are unique structures of FDM, can be seen in halos in cosmological FDM simulations. In this talk, we first provide our analytic model of the projected sub-galactic matter power spectrum originating from quantum clumps in FDM halos. Then we show a result of a comparison between our power spectrum model around the Einstein radius and that measured in the strong lens system SDSS J0252+0039. While we find that the current observation provides no useful constraint on the FDM mass, we show that future deep, high spatial resolution observations of strong lens systems can tightly constrain FDM with the mass around10^{-22}eV.","DM Astrophysics, Poster 11, Room 1",11,(format not fit),,,,

Here, heavy quarks of a confining gauge theory produced by de Sitter fluctuations are pushed apart by inflation and get confined after horizon re-entry. The large amount of energy stored in the colour flux tubes connecting the quark pair leads to black-hole formation. These are much lighter and can be of higher spin than those produced by standard collapse of horizon-size inflationary overdensities. Other difficulties exhibited by such mechanisms are also avoided. Phenomenological features of the new mechanism are discussed as well as accounting for both the entirety of the dark matter and the supermassive black holes in the galactic centres. Under proper conditions, the mechanism can be realised in a generic confinement theory, including ordinary QCD. Interestingly, for certain values of the string scale, the produced gravity waves are within the range of recent NANOGrav events. Simple generalisations of the mechanism allow for the existence of a significant scalar component of gravity waves with distinct observational signatures.","Primordial Black Holes, DM Theory, Poster 13, Room 1",13,,,,,

The mass and spin are fundamental properties of a black hole, and they can substantially affect the evaporation rate of the black hole. The evaporating black hole can inject energy into the intergalactic medium and heat the gas. Subsequently, it can modify the absorption in the global 21 cm signal. Therefore, the absorption feature in the 21 cm signal can provide a robust bound on primordial black holes.","Primordial Black Holes, Poster 14, Room 1",14,,,,,

Axion was originally introduced as the solution to the Strong CP problem, while DP is a massive vector particle predicted by an extension of the Standard Model. Both particles should experience coupling or mixing with photons, and thus can be used for dark matter direct detection.

   Here a new experimental approach is proposed to search both particles. This approach uses collective and coherent atoms as a target, Axion/DP inducing resonant atomic transition along with signal photon emission to be detected. The key feature of this method is the “coherent amplification”. That is, when the process occurs coherently in an N-atom system, its transition amplitude interferes constructively and the rate becomes proportional to N square instead of N. With such a huge amplification effect, we expect that the experiment may give new opportunities for finding Axion/DP dark matter or constraining their coupling/mixing parameter in the meV mass region.

   In this talk, I will explain this method in more detail and come up with a possible experimental setup.","Direct Detection, Poster 15, Room 2",15,,,,,

In the now observable energy region, a prominent background appears: It features an exponentially rising shape and rates more than two orders of magnitude higher than the flat background above 1 keV. It likely has different origins in different experiments, however, all of them are yet unknown. This background is the main limiting factor for multiple low threshold experiments, encouraging a collaborative search for an explanation. The EXCESS workshop, which took place in June 2021, is a joint effort of 10 experimental collaborations, discussing observations of the low energy background from 12 different measurements in its first iteration. The measurements were taken with cryogenic, CCD and gaseous ionization detectors, above and below ground, at temperatures between 15 mK and room temperature. The data of the presented measurements is available in a public data repository, together with tools to visualize their energy spectra.

Such interactions can lead to constructive or destructive interferences depending on the relative sign of couplings in the resulting scattering amplitudes. The recoil rates arising from such interactions exhibit distinct features, which, if seen in the next generation direct detection experiments, may point to definite model space. In order to verify this, we embark on an exercise of reconstructing the parameters of such complex models at current and future direct detection experiments like COSINUS, CRESST-III, and SuperCDMS. We demonstrate the importance of experimental parameters such as resolution, threshold, and exposure in such exercises. We furthermore show the usage of frequentist and bayesian approaches in an associated statistical framework.","Direct Detection, Poster 17, Room 2",17,,,,,

However, nuclearites could be distinguished from meteors mainly by their altitude (~ 10 km), velocity (~ 250 km/s), and motion direction of the bright flight. DIMS was designed to search for such fast-moving particles by observing the sky with wide-field and high-sensitivity CMOS cameras. In this contribution, we present the scientific motivations of DIMS, its experimental setup and the current status of the project. We discuss the procedure for the calibration of DIMS sensors by astronomical techniques and assess the achieved performance and sensitivity to meteors and nuclearites.

The method to reconstruct the global distribution is to superpose the stellar orbits to cover a large region. We adopt the stellar data from Gaia EDR3 and SDSS DR16 catalog as dynamical and photometric data, respectively. The selection condition to extract stellar halo data bases on the metallicity, [Fe/H] < -1. We obtain the result that the density distribution of more metal-rich stars forms more flattened shape. Furthermore, the velocity distribution in relatively metal-rich stars, -1.2 < [Fe/H] < -1.0, only forms disk-like structure with strong rotation, which is considered the metal-weak-thick-disk (MWTD). Our result of the relationship between the stellar metallicity and the shape of the halo is consistent with the galaxy formation model in CDM literature. On the other hand, the density distribution of GSE-like subsample creates an outer ridge at Galactocentric radius r ~ 20 kpc for -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.0, which is consistent with GSE's metallicity range. The ridge may show that the GSE's progenitor has an apocenter of ~ 20 kpc.","Indirect Detection, Poster 22, Room 2",22,,,,,

We study these two signals in the GC, and propose a new research for dSphs in our Galaxy.","Indirect Detection, Poster 27, Room 2",27,,,,,

We examine the prospect of an idealised gigaton detector like IceCube/KM3Net in probing such scenarios. Within this framework, we report an improved reach in spin-dependent and spin-independent dark matter nucleon cross-section below the current limits for dark matter masses in the TeV-PeV range.","Indirect Detection, DM Theory, DM Astrophysics, Poster 28, Room 2",28,,,,,
